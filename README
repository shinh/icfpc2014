* ai.rb and dsl.rb

A Lambda-man DSL, implemented in Ruby. It does:

- breadth first search for region close to lambdaman
- calculate score for each direction based on the location of pills
- wait ghost next to a power pill
- try not to go in a straight path where a ghost is coming
- try not to be too close to a ghost
- handle extreme maps (too big map, too many pills, etc.)
- prefer fruits
- etc.

* lman.rb and gen_lman_inst.rb

The backend assembler of the lambdaman AI.

* akabei.rb, ghost.rb, and gen_ghost_inst.rb

The ghost AI and its assembler. "Akabei" is named after blinky.

- Go to the location of lambdaman (or the location to which lambdaman
  is going, if you pass a parameter)
- When frighten or lambdaman is close to a power pill, it will go to
  the opposite direction.
- A small randomization.

* sim.go

A game simulator written in Go. It was fairly compatible with the
reference implementation until the timing of this was fixed :(
